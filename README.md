## Viability of using neural network machine learning to make Forex Trading decisions

The neural network is based around the one created by Daniel Shiffman. The neural network was used to master games like snake and flappy bird, 
so I wondered if it would be able to find a working strategy to trade on the Forex market. The data used was scrapped from the live 
trading platform “MetaTrader 5” using python, and further labeled based on confidential criteria. The data used to train the neural network
without going back to the beginning to stop the neural network from memorizing trading patterns.
